# Add2Cart
This web app allows users to add items to their cart, basically it's an add to cart app. I created it by drawing inspiration from Rafid Hodaâ€™s app, which I learned about through his YouTube lecture. After the lecture, I gained hands-on experience integrating Firebase with the web app, enabling real-time data synchronization and enhancing functionality. The app's core feature is a user-friendly cart system that stores items efficiently, making it perfect for add to cart tasks.
